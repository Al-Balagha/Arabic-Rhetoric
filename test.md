# Al-Balagha.com Arabic-Rhetoric Taxonomy 
### Version 0.1.0, 16 November 2025 ###
A structured, hierarchical, research-driven taxonomy of **Arabic rhetorical devices** by (al-Balagha.com, the Encyclopedia of Arabic Rhetoric)[https://al-balgha.com].

This repository serves as the **open, citable, versioned reference** for all rhetorical device classifications used in computational analysis, corpus annotation, and digital humanities scholarship, including the **BALAGHA Score** project.

## 🧭 Purpose
The al-Balagha.com Taxonomy provides:

- A **comprehensive classification** of Arabic rhetorical devices  
- Definitions grounded in classical sources with references to original sources.
- A stable versioned archive for citation in academic writing

## Versions
This release (v0.1.0) represents the **first publicly documented version**, accompanying the first description of the taxonomy in the following academic dissertation: https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2507.21106
. It is a **preliminary but functional** taxonomy and will be refined on an ongoing basis.

## 📚 Structure of the Taxonomy

The taxonomy is organised into six major categories:

1. **Word Order & Sentence Construction** (علم المعاني)  
2. **Figurative Speech** (علم البيان)  
3. **Linguistic Embellishments** (علم البديع)  
4. **Musicality & Sound Patterns**  
5. **Argumentation & Debate**  
6. **Paragraph Construction & Discourse-Level Rhetoric**

Within these categories, approximately **84 rhetorical devices** are defined according to:

- Name (Arabic + English)  
- Category  
- Definition  
- Function  
- Examples  
- Cross-references  
- Notes on usage, variants, and interpretation  

Full descriptive entries for each device are available at:  
**https://al-balagha.com**

## 📄 PDF Snapshots (Device Pages)

## 🧪 Versioning

This taxonomy uses **Semantic Versioning (SemVer)**:

- **0.x.x** = developmental, subject to change  
- **1.0.0** = planned stable release upon completion of the PhD  

Current release: **v0.1.0**

Future releases (0.2.0, 0.3.0, etc.) may include:
- Additional devices  
- Updated definitions  
- Reclassified categories  
- More examples and metadata  
- Computational/JSON schema alignment  

The **1.0.0 release** will freeze the taxonomy as the canonical reference.
