## 🔢 Changelog
🏷️ **2025-11-20 - [v0.1.1](https://github.com/Al-Balagha/Arabic-Rhetoric/tree/v0.1.1) (Machine-readable formats added)**  
This update introduces full machine-readable exports of the Arabic Rhetorical Device Taxonomy to support digital humanities research, linked-data workflows, and reproducible computational analysis.

Added in this release:

* A new **machine-readable/** directory containing:
	* [JSON](machine-readable/json)
	* [JSON-LD](machine-readable/jsonld)
	* [RDF/XML](machine-readable/rdfxml)
	* [TTL](machine-readable/ttl)
* Each file corresponds to a single rhetorical device (Q-item) from [**BalaghaBase.org**](https://balaghabase.org), the project's custom Wikibase instance.  
* Formats are aligned with semantic web standards and suitable for ingestion into digital humanities tools, corpus annotation systems, and knowledge graphs.  

This marks the first structured data release of the taxonomy, expanding its use beyond human-readable PDF/HTML formats into machine-actionable forms.

🏷️ **2022-09-06 - Initial draft (pre-release)**  
The first complete draft of the taxonomy was created and submitted as part of the [author's](https://marathe.org) [Masters dissertation](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2507.21106) at the University of Exeter. The taxonomy was created to assist in accurately identifying Arabic rhetorical devices in texts, as part of the author's [research project](https://project.balaghascore.com) to measure the [rhetorical density](https://rhetorical-density.com) of texts. 

* Rhetorical density is a novel quantitative linguistics metric devised by the author, based on the relative frequency analysis of rhetorical devices. It enables comparative measurement of rhetoricity across texts and genres. It is [defined](https://rhetorical-density.com/#what) as the number of rhetorical devices per 100 orthographic words or word units.

This early version of the taxonomy formed the conceptual foundation for identifying Arabic rhetorical devices consistently, and for building a stable ontology for rhetorical analysis.
