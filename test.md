# [Arabic Rhetoric Taxonomy](https://github.com/Al-Balagha/Arabic-Rhetoric) of the [Encyclopedia of Arabic Rhetoric](https://al-balagha.com)
#### Version 0.1.0, 16 November 2025 ####
A systematic, hierarchical classification of **Arabic rhetorical devices** by the [Encyclopedia of Arabic Rhetoric](https://al-balgha.com).

## About ##
This repository serves as the **open, citable, versioned reference** of the Arabic rhetorical device ontology of the Encyclopedia of Arabic Rhetoric. In development since 2022, the taxonomy is based on classical Arabic rhetorical theory (*al-balāgha*) and is suitable for use in computational analysis, corpus annotation, and digital humanities scholarship. The taxonomy is freely released under CC4.0 to promote the development of contemporary Arabic rhetorical studies, and is currently being used by the [**BALAGHA Score**](https://balaghascore.com) and other projects.

## 🧭 Purpose ##
The Arabic Rhetoric Taxonomy of the Encyclopedia of Arabic Rhetoric provides:
- A **comprehensive classification** of 84 Arabic rhetorical devices based on classical Arabic sources.
- All definitions grounded in classical sources with full references to original sources provided.
- Examples of rhetorical device usage are provided.
- A stable versioned repository for citation in academic writing.

## 🧪 Versioning ##
The taxonomy uses **Semantic Versioning (SemVer)**:
- 6 September 2022 - The taxonomy was first developed as part of an [academic dissertation](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2507.21106) submitted to the University of Exeter.
- 16 November 2025 - v0.1.0 - Release of the [**first publicly documented version**](https://github.com/Al-Balagha/Arabic-Rhetoric) of the taxonomy on GitHub.

## 📚 Structure of the Taxonomy
The taxonomy is organised into three major categories, mirroring classical scholarship:
1. **Word Order & Sentence Construction** (علم المعاني)
2. **Figurative Speech** (علم البيان)
3. **Linguistic Embellishments** (علم البديع) which has been further sub-divided into six sub-categories.

Within these categories, approximately **84 rhetorical devices** are defined according to:
- Name (English and Arabic)  
- Category  
- Definition  
- Function  
- Examples  
- Cross-references  
- Notes on usage, variants, and interpretation  
- References to classical sources

Additionally, a fourth category of linguistics defects which weak the rhetorical strengths has been added.

- A digital, machine-readable structure for DH/NLP work
It is a **preliminary but functional** taxonomy and will be refined on an ongoing basis.
