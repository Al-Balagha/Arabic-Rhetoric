In development since 2022, the taxonomy is based on classical Arabic rhetorical theory and is suitable for use in computational analysis, corpus annotation, and digital humanities scholarship. The taxonomy is freely released under CC4.0 to promote the development of contemporary Arabic rhetorical studies, and is currently being used by the [**BALAGHA Score**](https://balaghascore.com) and other projects.

- A **comprehensive classification** of 84 Arabic rhetorical devices based on classical Arabic sources.
- All definitions grounded in classical sources with full references to original sources provided.
- Examples of rhetorical device usage are provided.
- A stable versioned repository for citation in academic writing.

## Versions ##
- 6 September 2022 - The taxonomy was first developed during as part of the following academic dissertation: 
- 16 November 2025 - Release of the [**first publicly documented version** (v0.1.0)](https://github.com/Al-Balagha/Arabic-Rhetoric) on GitHub.


accompanying the first description of the taxonomy in the following academic dissertation: https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2507.21106
